I am a **problem solver** and enjoy learning new things at my own pace. I started learning web development in less than 2 years, _with 0 prior experience_, and already had an Internship in the area, developed a website, a blog, learned **Node.js**, **Sass**, discovered the power of **web services**, built **API's**, and _much more_.
